# ProgrammingJourney
## Greetings!
This Repository was built to keep record of the programs ive made along my path of learning numerous programming languages and topics.

## Feel free to browse through. 
I would love any suggestions or inputs on where i could improve or optimize my code, however it would be highly appreciated if you could share the logical reasoning behind the suggestion as well.
